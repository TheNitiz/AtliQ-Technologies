# AtliQ-Technologies

## Introduction

AtliQ Technologies formerly known as Atliq Hardware is a company which supplies hardware peripherals to different clients such as Sugre Stores, Epic Stores and to many more stores across the country.
AtliQ Hardware have a head office in Delhi, India and have a lot of regional offices throughout India. The Market is growing dynamically and the Sales Manager is facing issues
in tracking Sales and Insights of the Business. So, Whenever Sales Director wants Insights from the Reginal Managers they tells him that yeah the sales are good enough, or the sales are that much last quarter...something like that. But the Sales Manager of the company does not get the clear picture and are not happy with conversation. So the problem are the conversation happens are all verbal with the reginal managers.
Even after knowing that the sales are declining he cannot do much because he does not have the clear picture of sales. Even after asking for records he get some excel files from reginal managers...But we,humans are so boring with the numbers.

## Problem-Statement

Showing Sales Insights in Simplistic terms i.e. how Business is doing, what are the weakest areas we need to focus. So that we can focus more on areas where the sales are declining. So the sales director of the company wants a digestable visualization dashboard so he can connect with his business in a more better way as saying..."A Picture is worth a Thousand Words".

## Solution

Dataset are present online in SQL dump file [here](https://github.com/codebasics/DataAnalysisProjects/tree/master/1_SalesInsights)
I have made dashboards which shows Insights like:
* Top Customers by revenue and profit [see](https://github.com/TheNitiz/AtliQ-Technologies/blob/main/Dashboard_2.png)
* Top Products by revenue and profit [see](https://github.com/TheNitiz/AtliQ-Technologies/blob/main/Dashboard_6.png)
* Revenue, Sales Qty by year [see](https://github.com/TheNitiz/AtliQ-Technologies/blob/main/Dashboard_1.png)
* Profit % by market [see](https://github.com/TheNitiz/AtliQ-Technologies/blob/main/Dashboard_2.png)
* Revenue Contribution % and profit margin % by North, South and Central Zone. [see](https://github.com/TheNitiz/AtliQ-Technologies/blob/main/Dashboard_5.png)
and more on dashboards.

## Recommendations

Based on the dashboards Insights:

* Should Maintain healthy relationship with the customers in Bhubaneshwar, Hyderabad, Chennai as they are highest profit % by market.
* Make some stategy for Lucknow market as its revenue are less and also profit % are in negative.
* Figure out what need to be done as sales quantity in Kanpur, Surat, Patna, Bhubaneshwar, Chennai are the lowest.
* North zone have highest revenue contribution but lowest profit % whereas South zone have lowest revenue contribution but highest profit %. Try to increase customers in South zone.
* Delhi is the highest revenue contibutor and second highest profit contributor whereas Mumbai is the second highest revenue contributor and highest profit contributor. So its need to be implement the same market strategy as in mumbai to increase the profit % in Delhi.
